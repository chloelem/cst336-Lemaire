<h1 style="color:green;"> My story in Singapour </h1>

<p style="color:darkblue; font-family:verdana;" > One day, I was in Singapour for holidays, and I discovered the downtown. 

I was in the chinese area, looking around, and without taking care I threw my chewing-gum on the floor. 

I forgot that it is extremely banned in Singapour to have chewing-gum. 

So, a police officer came to see me and conventionally I must paid 1000$ fine. 

But because I'm a foreigner he said that he "gives me a chance". Finally, I think I'm a kind of lucky!</p>
