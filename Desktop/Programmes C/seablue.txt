The ocean looks blue because red, orange and yellow (long wavelength light) are absorbed more strongly 
by water than is blue (short wavelength light). So when white light from the sun enters the ocean, 
it is mostly the blue that gets returned. Same reason the sky is blue."
In other words, the color of the ocean and the color of the sky are related but occur independently 
of each other: in both cases, the preferential absorption of long-wavelength (reddish) light gives rise 
to the blue. Note that this effect only works if the water is very pure; if the water is full of mud, 
algae or other impurities, 
the light scattered off these impurities will overwhelm the water's natural blueness.

Pure water is of course clear. However if it is deep enough, so that light cannot reflect off the sea f
loor, it appears dark blue. This is largely because of some basic physics.
Water molecules are better at absorbing light that arrives in longer wavelengths, meaning the reds, oranges, 
yellows and greens. This mostly leaves the blues, which have shorter wavelengths. As blue light is 
less likely to be 
absorbed, it can penetrate to deeper depths, making deep water look bluer.
However, the purity of sea water varies. Particles suspended within it can increase the scattering of light. 
Sand and silt carried into the sea from rivers, or kicked up from the 
seafloor by waves and storms, can affect the colours of coastal waters. 
And organic detritus such as decayed plant matter - known to scientists as colour dissolved 
organic matter - 
can also complicate the picture, by adding greens, yellows or browns.
