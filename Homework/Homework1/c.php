     <p1>It was created in 1983 as an alternative to C, and instantly gained popularity, for good reason. 
     It features predefined classes that can be used alongside classes a programmer may already be using. 
     Microsoft Windows and Google Chrome are two of the most well known projects created with C++, and indeed, most of Adobe, and much of Amazon’s websites are written in C++.
     This programming language has remained in demand because it is a powerful tool that is adaptable in a variety of sectors, including Finance, Banking, Games, Telecoms, Electronic Banking, Retail, and more.

      <p2>  Indeed, learning C++ enables you to code apps as well as games and commercial software with ease. It’s one of the most powerful languages out there, and hosts a variety of features, including being platform dependent, 
      (i.e. the program is executed in the same operating system in which it was developed).</p2>

     <strong> Examples of structures in C++ </strong>
     <br /> <br />
     <li> #include iostream (library) </li> 
     <li> cout << "Hello world!<< (display something)</li>
     <li> cin >> value (read a value)</li>
     <li> int value; (initialize a variable)</li>
     <li> float value; (initialize a decimal variable)</li>
