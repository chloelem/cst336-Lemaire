     <p1>IA general purpose, object oriented programming language born in the 1993 by Yukihiro Matz Matsumoto. 
     It’s 5 times more in demand than Python, and one of the fastest growing programming languages, seen only to Java for the most projects completed. 
     In fact, Ruby is so easy to use you can create an app in it in under 10 minutes.
     Groupon, Airbnb, Pxlr, and Bloomberg are all coded in Ruby, as well as many more.

      <br />
      <p2>Ruby operates as a dynamic, object orientated, because it reads like English, it makes the code easy to read. 
      It’s needed to maintain code databases for many high end websites, so Ruby’s demand is increasing, so much so that it’s become common within DevOps roles, 
      i.e. the engineers ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the servers running websites with high traffic.
      Depending on your company’s needs, this could be the one for you.</p2>
